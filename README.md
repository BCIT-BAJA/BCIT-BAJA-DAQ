# Problem 
During the last BAJA competition,The BAJA team was unable to measure dynamic forces applied onto the suspension of the car. As a result, during the last competition, it bent.

The telemetry system for BCIT-BAJA car, collects strain across suspension components of car to allow BAJA to optimize material and reinforce weak areas of suspension.
As well as collect other data such as linear/angular acceleration.

There consists of 2 parts of this project. 

**PART B** the amplification of the (-15-15mV) analog strain signal to (0-3.0V) which is then routed to

**PART A**, which collects the 8 conditioned analog signals and is transmitted/received over a 900MHz antenna
